# Getting started

Follow these steps to get the server up and running:
  1) Install Node.js & MongoDB on your machine if you haven't already.
  2) Install the required dependencies: npm install
  3) In terminal, run the server by typing: npm run start

Server should now be listening to port 8000 on your local machine.
Access it through: localhost:8000
